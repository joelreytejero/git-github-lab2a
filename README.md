This project is a hands-on laboratory activity designed to introduce students to Git and GitHub fundamentals, progressing from local version control to basic collaboration workflows. Students create a multi-file project using different programming and web file types, initialize and manage a local Git repository, and practice essential version control tasks such as staging, committing, and viewing commit history. The activity then guides students through publishing the project to GitHub, creating and working with branches, making and merging changes, and finally cloning the repository to a new location. By the end of the lab, students demonstrate practical skills in repository management, branching and merging, and remote collaboration using GitHub, supported by documented command-line evidence and screenshots.
